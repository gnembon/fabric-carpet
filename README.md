Cause all carpets are made of fabric?  
This is the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) version of Carpet Mod, for Minecraft 1.14.X, 1.15.X, 1.16.X and above.  

Carpet Mod is a mod for vanilla Minecraft that allows you to take full control of what matters from a technical perspective of the game.

* Test your farms over several hours in only a few minutes using [`/tick warp`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#commandtick)
* ...and then see a detailed breakdown of the items they produce using [`hopperCounters`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#hoppercounters)
* See the server mobcap, TPS, etc. update live with [`/log`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#commandlog)
* Let pistons push block entities (ie. chests) with [`movableBlockEntities`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#movableblockentities)
* [Fix](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#leadfix) [many](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#portalsuffocationfix) [things](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#unloadedentityfix)

# Carpet mod ecosystem

For core carpet functionality, this is the right place. Check available downloads on the [release page](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnembon/carpet-extra/master/src/main/resources/assets/carpet-extra/icon.png" align="right" width="128px"/>

## carpet-extra

Check [carpet-extra](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra/) add-on mod for more whacky and crazy features, including autocrafting, block-placing dispensers, and even chicken-shearing!

## auto crafting table

Due to compatibility issues with vanilla and other mods, download [auto crafting table](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-autoCraftingTable/releases) by Skyrising as a separate add-on to carpet

## scarpet app store

If you want to browse or contribute to the scarpet app store check available apps, go [here](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet), its free!

## quick-carpet

Have problems with the recent snapshot or someone is slacking with releasing the base carpet mod, but you need some basic carpet functionality, check the minimal build of [quick-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/quick-carpet/releases). It hopefully works just fine. You will not be able to add any extensions or use scarpet apps on this one though.

## Other community-based extensions to carpet

Here is a [list of other carpet extensions](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/List-of-Carpet-extensions) created by the community.

Everybody can create your own carpet features or extend scarpet language with some new API, by creating a carpet extension using this [carpet extension mod template](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet-extension-example-mod). 

# How? Hwat?

Follow instructions for all other fabric mods in https://fabricmc.net/use/ and dump [carpet...jar](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases) in `mods` folder along with other compatible mods.
