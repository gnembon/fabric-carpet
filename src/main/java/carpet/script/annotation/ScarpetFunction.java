/**
 * <p>Defines a method that can be used as a function in the Scarpet language.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Methods annotated with this annotation are not required to accept and return the typical {@code Context context, Integer t, List<Value> lv}, but
 * instead can specify whatever parameters they actually need that will be automatically converted from their respective {@link Value}s and passed to
 * the method as the expected type. Functions will automatically fail if given parameters are not compatible with the specified ones, or if the number
 * of provided arguments is either too large or too small.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Types to be used in those functions must be already registered in their respective {@link ValueConverter} implementations.<br>
 * In order to register a new type to convert to, you can do so in {@link SimpleTypeConverter#registerType(Class, Class, java.util.function.Function, String)},
 * and in order to register a new variant of {@link Value}, use {@link ValueCaster#register(Class, String)}.<br>
 * In order to convert the output of your method to a {@link LazyValue} you will also need to register its conversion in {@link OutputConverter}</p>
 * 
 * <p>In order for Carpet to find methods annotated with this annotation, you must add your function class(es) to Carpet by running
 * {@link AnnotationParser#parseFunctionClass(Class)} ONCE. The provided {@link Class} must be concrete and provide the default constructor or an
 * equivalent to it.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Methods annotated with this annotation must not declare throwing any checked exceptions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If one of the method's parameters is {@link Context}, Carpet will pass the actual {@link Context} of the expression to the
 * method. If one of the method's parameters is {@link Context.Type}, Carpet will pass the Context Type the function was called inside. That
 * is different from the Context Type provided in this annotation in that it's the one it was called with, while the one in the annotation
 * is the one that will be used when evaluating the lazy values passed to the function.</p>
