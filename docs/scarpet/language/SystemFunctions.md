# System functions

## Type conversion functions

### `copy(expr)`

Returns the deep copy of the expression. Can be used to copy mutable objects, like maps and lists

### `type(expr)`

Returns the string value indicating type of the expression. Possible outcomes 
are `null, number, string, list, iterator`, as well as minecraft related concepts like `block, entity, nbt`

### `bool(expr)`

Returns a boolean context of the expression. Note that there are no true/false values in scarpet. `true` is 
alias of 1, and `false` is 0\. Bool is also interpreting string values as boolean, which is different from other 
places where boolean context can be used. This can be used in places where API functions return string values to 
represent binary values

<pre>
bool(pi) => 1
bool(false) => 0
bool('') => 0
bool(l()) => 0
bool(l('')) => 1
bool('foo') => 1
bool('false') => 0
bool('nulL') => 0
if('false',1,0) => 1
</pre>

### `number(expr)`

Returns a numeric context of the expression. Can be used to read numbers from strings

<pre>
number(null) => null
number(false) => 0
number('') => null
number('3.14') => 3.14
number(l()) => 0
number(l('')) => 1
number('foo') => null
number('3bar') => null
number('2')+number('2') => 4
</pre>

### `str(expr, params? ... ), str(expr, param_list)`

Returns a formatted string representing expression. Accepts formatting style accepted by `String.format`. 
Supported types (with `"%?"` syntax):

*   `d`, `o`, `x`: integers, octal, hex
*   `a`, `e`, `f`, `g`: floats
*   `b`: booleans
*   `s`: strings

<pre>
str(null) => null
str(false) => 0
str('') => null
str('3.14') => 3.14
str(l()) => 0
str(l('')) => 1
str('foo') => null
str('3bar') => null
str(2)+str(2) => 22
str('pi: %.2f',pi) => 'pi: 3.14'
str('player at: %d %d %d',pos(player())) => 'player at: 567, -2423, 124'
</pre>

## Threading and Parallel Execution

Scarpet allows to run threads of execution in parallel to the main script execution thread. In Minecraft, the main 
thread scripts are executed on the main server thread. Since Minecraft is inherently NOT thread safe, it is not that 
beneficial to parallel execution in order to access world resources faster. Both `GetBlockState` and `setBlockState` 
are not thread safe and require the execution to park on the server thread, where these requests can be executed in 
the off-tick time in between ticks that didn't take 50ms. There are however benefits of running things in parallel, 
like fine time control not relying on the tick clock, or running things independent on each other. You can still run 
your actions on tick-by-tick basis, either taking control of the execution using `game_tick()` API function 
(nasty solution), or scheduling tick using `schedule()` function (much nicer solution), but threading often gives 
the neatest solution to solve problems in parallel 
(see [scarpet camera](/src/main/resources/assets/carpet/scripts/camera.sc)).

Due to limitations with the game, there are some limits to the threading as well. You cannot for 
instance `join_task()` at all from the main script and server thread, because any use of Minecraft specific 
function that require any world access, will require to park and join on the main thread to get world access, 
meaning that calling join on that task would inevitably lead to a typical deadlock. You can still join tasks 
from other threads, just because the only possibility of a deadlock in this case would come explicitly from your 
bad code, not the internal world access behaviour. Some things tough like player or entity manipulation, can be 
effectively parallelized.

### `task(function, ?args...., ?executor)`

Creates and runs a parallel task, returning the handle to the task object. Task will return the return value of the 
function when its completed, or will return `null` immediately if task is still in progress, so grabbing a value of 
a task object is non-blocking. Function can be either function value, or function lambda, or a name of an existing 
defined function. In case function needs arguments to be called with, they should be supplied after the function 
name, or value. Optional `executor` identifier is to place the task in a specific queue identified by this value. 
The default thread value is the `null` thread. There is no limits on number of parallel tasks for any executor, 
so using different queues is solely for synchronization purposes. Also, since `task` function knows how many extra 
arguments it requires, the use of tailing optional parameter for the custom executor thread pool is not ambiguous.

<pre>
task( _() -> print('Hello Other World') )  => Runs print command on a separate thread
foo(a, b) -> print(a+b); task('foo',2,2)  => Uses existing function definition to start a task
task('foo',3,5,'temp');  => runs function foo with a different thread executor, identified as 'temp'
a = 3; task( _(outer(a), b) -> foo(a,b), 5, 'temp')  
    => Another example of running the same thing passing arguments using closure over anonymous function as well as passing a parameter.
</pre>

### `task_count(executor?)`

If no argument provided, returns total number of tasks being executed in parallel at this moment using scarpet 
threading system. If the executor is provided, returns number of active tasks for that provider. Use `task_count(null)` 
to get the task count of the default executor only.

### `task_value(task)`

Returns the task return value, or `null` if task hasn't finished yet. Its a non-blocking operation. Unlike `join_task`, 
can be called on any task at any point

### `task_join(task)`

Waits for the task completion and returns its computed value. If the task has already finished returns it immediately. 
Unless taking the task value directly, i.e. via `task_value`, this operation is blocking. Since Minecraft has a 
limitation that all world access operations have to be performed on the main game thread in the off-tick time, 
joining any tasks that use Minecraft API from the main thread would mean automatic lock, so joining from the main 
thread is not allowed. Join tasks from other threads, if you really need to, or communicate asynchronously with 
the task via globals or function data / arguments to monitor its progress, communicate, get partial results, 
or signal termination.

### `task_completed(task)`

Returns true if task has completed, or false otherwise.

### `synchronize(lock, expression)`

Evaluates `expression` synchronized with respect to the lock `lock`. Returns the value of the expression.

## Auxiliary functions

### `lower(expr), upper(expr), title(expr)`

Returns lowercase, uppercase or titlecase representation of a string representation of the passed expression

<pre>
lower('aBc') => 'abc'
upper('aBc') => 'ABC'
title('aBc') => 'Abc'
</pre>

### `replace(string, regex, repl?); replace_first(string, regex, repl?)`

Replaces all, or first occurence of a regular expression in the string with `repl` expression, 
or nothing, if not specified

<pre>
replace('abbccddebfg','b+','z')  // => azccddezfg
replace_first('abbccddebfg','b+','z')  // => azccddebfg
</pre>

### `length(expr)`

Returns length of the expression, the length of the string, the length of the integer part of the number, 
or length of the list

<pre>
length(pi) => 1
length(pi*pi) => 1
length(pi^pi) => 2
length(l()) => 0
length(l(1,2,3)) => 3
length('') => 0
length('foo') => 3
</pre>

### `rand(expr), rand(expr, seed)`

returns a random number from `0.0` (inclusive) to `expr` (exclusive). In boolean context (in conditions, 
boolean functions, or `bool`), returns false if the randomly selected value is less than 1\. This means 
that `rand(2)` returns true half of the time and `rand(5)` returns true for 80% (4/5) of the time. If seed is not 
provided, uses a random seed. If seed is provided, each consecutive call to rand() will act like 'next' call to the 
same random object. Scarpet keeps track of up to 1024 custom random number generators, so if you exceed this number 
(per app), then your random sequence will revert to the beginning.

<pre>
map(range(10), floor(rand(10))) => [5, 8, 0, 6, 9, 3, 9, 9, 1, 8]
map(range(10), bool(rand(2))) => [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
map(range(10), str('%.1f',rand(_))) => [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.9, 2.8, 3.8, 5.3, 2.2, 1.6, 5.6]
</pre>

### `perlin(x), perlin(x, y), perlin(x, y, z), perlin(x, y, z, seed)`

returns a noise value from `0.0` to `1.0` (roughly) for 1, 2 or 3 dimensional coordinate. The default seed it samples 
from is `0`, but seed can be specified as a 4th argument as well. In case you need 1D or 2D noise values with custom 
seed, use `null` for `z`, or `y` and `z` arguments respectively.

Perlin noise is based on a square grid and generates rougher maps comparing to Simplex, which is creamier. 
Querying for lower-dimensional result, rather than affixing unused dimensions to constants has a speed benefit,

Thou shall not sample from noise changing seed frequently. Scarpet will keep track of the last 256 perlin seeds 
used for sampling providing similar speed comparing to the default seed of `0`. In case the app engine uses more 
than 256 seeds at the same time, switching between them can get much more expensive.

### `simplex(x, y), simplex(x, y, z), simplex(x, y, z, seed)`

returns a noise value from `0.0` to `1.0` (roughly) for 2 or 3 dimensional coordinate. The default seed it samples 
from is `0`, but seed can be specified as a 4th argument as well. In case you need 2D noise values with custom seed, 
use `null` for `z` argument.

Simplex noise is based on a triangular grid and generates smoother maps comparing to Perlin. To sample 1D simplex 
noise, affix other coordinate to a constant.

Thou shall not sample from noise changing seed frequently. Scarpet will keep track of the last 256 simplex seeds 
used for sampling providing similar speed comparing to the default seed of `0`. In case the app engine uses more 
than 256 seeds at the same time, switching between them can get much more expensive.

### `print(expr)`

prints the value of the expression to chat. Passes the result of the argument to the output unchanged, 
so `print`-statements can be weaved in code to debug programming issues

<pre>
print('foo') => results in foo, prints: foo
a = 1; print(a = 5) => results in 5, prints: 5
a = 1; print(a) = 5 => results in 5, prints: 1
print('pi = '+pi) => prints: pi = 3.141592653589793
print(str('pi = %.2f',pi)) => prints: pi = 3.14
</pre>

### `sleep(expr)`

Halts the execution of the program (and the game itself) for `expr` milliseconds. All in all, its better to 
use `game_tick(expr)` to let the game do its job while the program waits

<pre>
sleep(50)
</pre>

### `time()`

Returns the number of milliseconds since 'some point', like Java's `System.nanoTime()`. 
It returns a float, which has 1 microsecond precision (0.001 ms)

<pre>
start_time = time();
flip_my_world_upside_down();
print(str('this took %d milliseconds',time()-start_time))
</pre>

### `profile_expr(expression)`

Returns number of times given expression can be run in 50ms time. Useful to profile and optimize your code. 
Note that, even if its only a number, it WILL run these commands, so if they are destructive, you need to be careful.

* * *

## Access to variables and stored functions (use with caution)

### `var(expr)`

Returns the variable under the name of the string value of the expression. Allows to manipulate variables in more 
programmatic manner, which allows to use local variable set with a hash map type key-value access, 
can also be used with global variables

<pre>
a = 1; var('a') = 'foo'; a => a == 'foo'
</pre>

### `undef(expr)`

Removes all bindings of a variable with a name of `expr`. Removes also all function definitions with that name. 
It can affect global variable pool, and local variable set for a particular function.

<pre>
inc(i) -> i+1; foo = 5; inc(foo) => 6
inc(i) -> i+1; foo = 5; undef('foo'); inc(foo) => 1
inc(i) -> i+1; foo = 5; undef('inc'); undef('foo'); inc(foo) => Error: Function inc is not defined yet at pos 53
undef('pi')  => bad idea - removes hidden variable holding the pi value
undef('true')  => even worse idea, unbinds global true value, all references to true would now refer to the default 0
</pre>

### `vars(prefix)`

It returns all names of variables from local scope (if prefix does not start with 'global') or global variables 
(otherwise). Here is a larger example that uses combination of `vars` and `var` functions to be 
used for object counting

<pre>
/script run
$ count_blocks(ent) -> (
$   l(cx, cy, cz) = query(ent, 'pos');
$   scan(cx, cy, cz, 16, 16, 16, var('count_'+_) += 1);
$   for ( sort_key( vars('count_'), -var(_)),
$     print(str( '%s: %d', slice(_,6), var(_) ))
$   )
$ )
/script run count_blocks(player())
</pre>

## System key-value storage

Scarpet runs apps in isolation. The can share code via use of shared libraries, but each library that is imported to 
each app is specific to that app. Apps can store and fetch state from disk, but its restricted to specific locations 
meaning apps cannot interact via disk either. To facilitate communication for interappperability, scarpet hosts its 
own key-value storage that is shared between all apps currently running on the host, providing methods for getting an 
associated value with optional setting it if not present, and an operation of modifying a content of a system 
global value.

### `system_variable_get(key, default_value ?)`

Returns the variable from the system shared key-value storage keyed with a `key` value, optionally if value is 
not present, and default expression is provided, sets a new value to be associated with that key

### `system_variable_set(key, new_value)`

Returns the variable from the system shared key-value storage keyed with a `key` value, and sets a new 
mapping for the key
