# Iterating over larger areas of blocks

These functions help scan larger areas of blocks without using generic loop functions, like nested `loop`.

### `scan(cx, cy, cz, dx, dy, dz, px?, py?, pz?, expr)`

Evaluates expression over area of blocks defined by its center (`cx, cy, cz`), expanded in all directions 
by `dx, dy, dz` blocks, or optionally in negative with `d` coords, and `p` coords in positive values. `expr` 
receives `_x, _y, _z` as coords of current analyzed block and `_`, which represents the block itself.

### `volume(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, expr)`

Evaluates expression for each block in the area, the same as the `scan`function, but using two opposite corners of 
the rectangular cuboid. Any corners can be specified, its like you would do with `/fill` command.

### `neighbours(x, y, z), neighbours(block), neighbours(l(x,y,z))`

Returns the list of 6 neighbouring blocks to the argument. Commonly used with other loop functions like `for`.

<pre>
for(neighbours(x,y,z),air(_)) => 4 // number of air blocks around a block
</pre>

### `rect(cx, cy, cz, dx?, dy?, dz?, px?, py?, pz?)`

returns an iterator, just like `range` function that iterates over rectangular cubarea of blocks. If only center 
point is specified, it iterates over 27 blocks. If `d` arguments are specified, expands selection of respective 
number of blocks in each direction. If `p` arguments are specified, it uses `d` for negative offset, and `p` for positive.

### `diamond(cx, cy, cz, radius?, height?)`

Iterates over a diamond like area of blocks. With no radius and height, its 7 blocks centered around the middle 
(block + neighbours). With a radius specified, it expands shape on x and z coords, and with a custom height, on y. 
Any of these can be zero as well. radius of 0 makes a stick, height of 0 makes a diamond shape pad.
